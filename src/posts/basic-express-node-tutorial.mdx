## Introduction

If you want to get started with NodeJS web apps, here’s a great place to start. We will build a basic app that displays Quotes on a page. This tutorial covers the following steps:

- Setting up a NodeJS project
- Creating a web server with express
- Using the EJS template engine library
- Sending external data to our templates with Express Middleware

## Setup

For this tutorial, I will assume you have NodeJS and NPM installed on your development environment. If you don’t have either of those things installed, I recommend the following links depending on your operating system:

- Windows
  - http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Install+NodeJS+and+NPM+on+Windows
- Linux (Ubuntu) and Mac OS X
  - http://nodesource.com/blog/installing-node-js-tutorial-using-nvm-on-mac-os-x-and-ubuntu/

For this tutorial I will be using Node version 8.9.4 and NPM version 5.6.0.

If you have Node and NPM installed, running the following commands in your terminal will check the versions:

- NODE VERSION:
  - `node -v`
- NPM VERSION:
  - `npm -v`

Lastly, you should have a good code editor ready. I use Visual Studio Code. It is a great editor, with a built-in file manager and an integrated terminal. You can download it from [this site](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Now that you are set up, it is time to start coding!

## Walk-through

### Creating A Node Project

Start by creating a directory you would like to work out of. Mine is ~/myapp. Using your terminal, move into this directory and run the following command:`npm init -y`.

This should have created a package.json file in your directory. Create a file that matches the “main” key in you package.json file. My file is index.js. Now that we have the project ready, we can move on.

### Installing Dependencies

For the app we will be using Express as our web server so we need to install the Express module using npm. From your project directory open a terminal and run the command `npm i -s express ejs`. You should now have a node\_modules directory. Express and the EJS template engine were installed in that directory.

### Creating your Express App

You need to pull express from the node\_modules folder and use it in your index.js file. to do this, add the following lines to the top of index.js:  
`var express = require('express')
var app = express()
`  
This creates an app using express that we will add functionality to in the next steps.

In order to run the express app, you need to add the following line to the bottom of your index.js file:  
`app.listen(3000)`  
This runs your server at `http://localhost:3000`.  
Keep this line at the bottom of your index.js file. Whenever we add more code to the page, we will add it above this line.

### Serving Static Files

We need a folder that we can serve our static files (css, images, javascript, etc.) from.

Create a folder called ‘public’ in your directory. This will hold our static files.

Add the following line to your index.js file:  
`app.use(express.static('public'))`

Whe a static resource is requested, your app will now look in the public folder. as a note, the app does nnot consider the name of the public foldder in the request. For example, f the page looks for `js/test.js`, you app will look for it in `public/js/test/js`.

### Adding Routes

Our first route will handle a simple GET request to our base route ‘/’. This means that any GET request sent specifically to `http://localhost:3000` will be handled by this route. This is where we will eventually have the logic for our main page.

To get started, add the following lines to your index.js file:  
```js
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
res.send('HELLO WORLD')
})
```

You can test to see if this works by opening a terminal in your directory and running `node index.js`. Once you have done that, you can navigate to ‘http://localhost:3000’in your browser and you should see your content.

### Creating a View Template with EJS

This takes a few steps. First, create a ‘views’ folder in your app directory. Next, create a file in your ‘views’ directory called ‘index.ejs’. Put the following content in that file:  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Quotes</title>
  <style>
    .quote{
      border: 2px solid black;
      margin: 5px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Quotes:</h1>
  <div class="quote">
    <p><QUOTE GOES HERE></p>
    <p>~ <AUTHOR GOES HERE%></p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Next, you have to tell the app to render this file when the ‘/’ route is requested.

To do this, you first need to add the following two lines to your ‘index.js’ file before your route, and after you declare ‘app’:  
```js
app.set('views', 'views');
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
```

Last, you need to tell the app to render the file by replacing  `res.send('HELLO WORLD')` in your route with the following line:  
`res.render('index')`

If you run your server, it should show you your template file with an example quote.

We are ready for the final step.

### Sending Data to the View

To accomplish this step, we are going to need to do some setup. First, we will need to create a folder called ‘controllers’ that will contain all of our data-handling files and functions. Net, we will create a file called ‘quotes.js’ in our controllers folder. In that file, we will add some dummy data:  
```js
var data = [
  {
    author: "Chance",
    quote: "Cliche web tutorials are lame."
  },
  {
    author: "Yoda",
    quote: "Do, or do not. There is no 'try'"
  },
  {
    author: "Ben Franklin",
    quote: "A penny saved is a penny earned."
  },
  {
    author: "Dr. Seuss",
    quote: "Don't cry because it's over, smile becuse it happened."
  }
]
```
Next, we will export a function that our app can use to get this data:  
`exports.getData = function() {
return {
quotes: data
}
}`  
In ‘index.js’, we need to require the controller. to do this, add the line `var Quotes = require('./controllers/quotes');` before your route.  
Now that we have the data, we need to send it to our view. Replace `res.render('index')` in our route with:  
`res.render('index', Quotes.getData())`  
The view now has the data. Replacing the example div with the following code will allow the view to loop through the data and print it to the page:  
```ejs
<% for (quote of quotes) { %>
<div class="quote">
<p><%=quote.quote%></p>
<p>~ <%=quote.author%></p>
</div>
<%}%>
```
